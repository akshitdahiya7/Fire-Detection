# ðŸ”¥ Real-Time Fire Detection using YOLOv8

This project implements a **real-time fire detection system** using the YOLOv8 object detection model. It is capable of identifying fire in live video streams and triggering automated email alerts with captured snapshots when fire is detected.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- **Real-Time Detection**: Uses YOLOv8 and OpenCV to detect fire from live video streams or recorded videos.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved **89.4% precision** and **80.4% recall** on validation set.
- **Automated Alerts**: Sends an email with a snapshot of the fire incident using SMTP and MIME protocols.
- **Custom Dataset**: Trained on a labeled dataset specifically curated for fire detection.
- **Scalable**: Can be integrated into existing surveillance systems.
